#lg2zim

converts Lifeograph diary files to zim directories

(this is very rough, i just wanted to extract all the entries from my diary to check something quickly, i'll finish this eventually)

TODO
* proper timestamps in output
    * will this fix sorting? right now they're sorted alphabetically
      since they all have the same timestamp (0 AD)
* formatting

does not support
* tags
* converting encrypted diary files
